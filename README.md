### QR Code Generator with Tkinter

This Python project generates a custom QR code using the `qrcode` library and displays it in a Tkinter window. The code allows users to create a QR code with a specified URL and custom colors (pink and black). The generated QR code is shown directly in a Tkinter-based GUI, eliminating the need for an external image viewer. The window stays open until manually closed, providing an integrated and user-friendly way to view and share QR codes.

#### Features:
- Customizable QR code generation.
- Seamless display within a Tkinter window.
- Easy to run and view the QR code directly.
